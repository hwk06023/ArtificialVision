* Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce if applicable. <br/> 

### Making Changes
Making Changes
1. Create a new branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name
    ```

2. Make and commit your changes. Keep your commits small and focused; they should relate to the issue you're addressing.

3. Write meaningful commit messages that provide context for your changes.
 <br/>

### Submitting Pull Requests
